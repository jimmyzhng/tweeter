# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. In this project, we showcased our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as our Node and Express back-end skills.

## Screenshots

Here is how it turned out!

When we post a tweet, it gives us a random username, along with a random name and avatar. We make use of the timeago jQuery plugin to support time stamps that are updated automatically.

When resized to a width of under 1024px, our page adjusts to a cleaner look, thanks to our usage of media queries.

When we try to post a tweet without any text, we get a nice error message that is animated with a slide effect.

This also happens when our tweet is above 140 characters, just like actual Twitter!
